<h3>Sheetlytics â€“ free, privacy conscious, website analytics</h3>

<h1>
  Are you cheap? <br />
  Do you complain about privacy on Twitter? <br />
  Do you hate Google, but love that Google Analytics is free?
</h1>
<h3>Same. So we're doing something about it.</h3>

<p>Google Analytics has been powering the web for years.</p>
<p>
  It's a great service, but developers have woken up. We don't want to contribute to Google tracking
  their users across the web. We don't want to deal with GDPR compliance. We just want to know how
  much traffic we're getting.
</p>

<p>The mission is simple:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Free hosting</li>
  <li>Basic analytics</li>
  <li>No tracking cookies, GDPR compliant</li>
</ul>
